Research Project in "Polymer Rheology" 

The viscosity of the polymer solution is the key property for the successful application of polymer flooding. Polymers are generally non-Newtonian and the viscosity is a function of shear rate, polymer concentration, salinity, hardness, temperature, and molecular weight. In this study, we will employ various machine learning techniques namely, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) to model the viscosity of a HPAM Polymer (Floppam 3330S).
